              In its Dedicatory plaque, at the Enterprise Tower, U.S. Naval Academy, here
              it is written that it is "The carrier that fought the most through the entire war...".
              <br><br>
              The <em>USS Enterprise</em> joined the war on December 7, 1941, after Japanese planes bombed Pearl Harbor.
              Among the major engagements that occured in the Pacific, the Enterprise went through all except 2.
              <br><br>
              On May 14, 1945, a Kamikaze attack managed to criple the Enterprise, forcing it to leave the war.
              As the ship managed to down numerous planes and ships, it then became known as the <br>
              <h3 style="text-align: center;"><em>"The most decorated ship of the Second World War</em>".</h3>
              <p>Ultimately, the presence of the Enterprise, especially in the Pacific Sea 
                and the events that surrounded the Philippines truly helped shaped the future of the country and the world.</p>
